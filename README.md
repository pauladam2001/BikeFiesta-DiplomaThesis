**BikeFiesta** is my diploma thesis, a marketplace for used bicycles.

In this study, I present a comprehensive analysis of BikeFiesta, a web application for buying and selling used bicycles. The platform is designed to connect buyers and sellers in a convenient and secure way, while also providing advanced features, such as 2-factor authentication or payment processing. My approach utilizes a range of cutting-edge technologies, including Ruby on Rails and Python, along with TensorFlow, Pillow, OpenCV, and Dlib libraries, as well as cloud-based services such as Cloudinary and Twilio. Notably, I use face extraction to extract the profile picture of a user from the ID Card uploaded at registration and image classification to verify if at least one image associated with a sale post is a bicycle.
